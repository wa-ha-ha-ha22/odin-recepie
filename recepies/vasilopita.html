        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 10-inch round cake pan.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a medium bowl until lighter in color; stir in flour and mix until the mixture is mealy. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Combine baking powder and milk; add to egg mixture, mix well. Combine lemon juice and baking soda; stir into the batter. Pour into the prepared cake pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
